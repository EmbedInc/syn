                             11 February 2024

test_syn [options]

Program to test the syntax of a .SYN syntax defintion file.  The syntax
definition file is parsed, and the resulting syntax trees shown.

The command line options are:

  -IN filename
  filename

    Provides the name of the syntax definition file to parse.  The second
    form of this command line option without the -IN keyword is for
    convenience when the file name does not start with a dash (-).  In
    either case, the mandatory ".syn" file name suffix may be omitted.

    The default input file name is "t.syn" in the current directory.
